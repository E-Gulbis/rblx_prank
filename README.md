# This is a harmless prank.

The folder contains all that you need. It will open "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley after double-clicking.
The folder "joks" (Translation: joke) contains all that you need for this prank. It has a counter within to count how many have fallen for it.
Just place the folder off the desktop and create a desktop shortcut for the `roblox.bat` file and point back to the folder and use the Roblox icon as the shortcut icon to make it more believable.
